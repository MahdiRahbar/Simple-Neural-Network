# Simple-Neural-Network

## Description 

This repository contains simple, useful and functional code of some of the most famous Neural Networks. These codes and the enthusiasm to create this repository comes from Neural Network Course of IAU-TNB lectured by professor [Dr. Mohammad Manthouri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-mansouri-07030766/).
Soon I will update this repo with more discriptions and usage guide.
